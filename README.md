### Bike Share Data Analysis

This project is an interactive Python program for exploring bike share data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City and Washington, DC.  The code imports the data from the city that the user selects, filters it by month and day of week if requested by the user, calculates and displays descriptive statistics, and then gives the user the option to step through the data set 5 rows at a time.
